This course introduces contemporary techniques for urban design representation that bring meaning to questions which underlie the nature of how urban designers think, work, and communicate. In conjunction with the UD studio, the primary objective of this class is to provide an entry point into digital software that explores innovative approaches for urban design. Critical discussions surrounding design methodologies begin the initial semester that requires a quick ramp-up of individual digital skills. Therefore, workshops are scheduled early in the term to immerse students into a culture of thinking and making “things” as part of an urban designer’s robust creative process. Students learn geographic information systems, 3d modeling and video making programs while gaining experience with efficient cross-platform workflows with collaboration in mind. This class accommodates individuals with low to advanced digital skills.

By combining conventions of different representational techniques, students are offered opportunities to discover the value of spatial data exploration and analysis (ArcGIS); descriptive and generative 3d modeling (Rhino, Grasshopper) and multimedia storytelling with motion graphics compiled as video (AfterEffects) into new constructs for envisioning urban spaces. The instruction and use of these multiple formats broaden possibilities for idea development and articulation, while supporting a nonlinear process that requires refinement and a concise decision making process. By virtue of provocation, content-rich techniques enables students to grapple with the navigation of their individual agency across collaborative settings broaden reach. 

The course is structured through a series of exercises motivated by select viewing of students’ work of: mappings, diagrams, drawings and video. Lessons are delivered in a classroom setting and supported by lab working sessions. Individual skills developed in this course are expected to be furthered in the design studio across all semesters of the program. Urban design students are encouraged to move beyond this introduction to software by exploring other GSAPP offerings in the Visual Studies electives to strengthen their skillsets in the following semesters.

**Requirements**

The course format will consist of software instruction, class discussions, and tutorial (desk interaction) sessions. There will be a series of exercises that sequentially leads to a final product of design research. Each student will be responsible for completing 3d work. Over the semester your individual work contributes to a broader way to think about design research. When groups of two are formed, every student is expected to be responsible for equal contribution. Exercises will vary in submitted material ranging from prints to successive digital file uploads as a record of your methods. DTEQ will use Instagram as public space for viewing and learning.

**Urban Topics**

We will structure DTEQ coursework through an investigation about public space in the contemporary city. New York City will be the stage where students will be asked to explore the meaning of public. A series of linked exercises will allow you to learn different software to visualize and understand urban systems and their visible and invisible relationships across urban space. Initially the subject of neighborhood will require you to observe, record, retrieve, and ultimately identify and question how to re-present your nuanced perspective of an innovative understanding of the public realm. Understanding the physical makeup of the commons will be the vehicle in which you are asked to develop your advancing skillset of digital techniques for urban design study and speculation.

**Digital Representation Techniques**

1. Scale: nesting composites, overlays, zooming, key guides
2. Layering: elemental, compositing
3. Simultaneous information: windows, tiles, schedules, co-present legibility
4. Comparative analysis: overlays, tiles, metrics
5. Transitioning: growth, shrink, decay, speed, gradient
6. Point-of-view: camera, zoom, display and shooting mechanics
7. Urban flux: night and day times, congestions, tides, seasons, cycles, flows, pressures

**Representation Objectives**

1. Mapping as an intentional endeavor purposed with agency
2. Choosing an appropriate format: orthographics, aerials, sections, animations
3. Understand the nature, mechanics, and techniques of presenting urban design ideas 
4. Strategic use of communication forms and effects

**Evaluation**

In DTEQ, creative uses of GIS data and demonstrating a content-rich range of 2d and 3d visualization techniques consistently while engaging in group work will qualify for a high-pass grade. Posting work-in-progress in a timely manner to support individual and shared learning experiences is required. Due to the time sensitive nature of the digital instruction, multiple absences may result in hindering individual skills learning and affect group collaboration efforts. This may result in a low-pass grade or a failing grade. Consult the GSAPP student handbook for grading and program requirement policies.
